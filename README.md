**GitHub Repository Analyzer**

A tool that analyzes any GitHub user’s profile and provides insights about their repositories, including most-used languages, stars, forks, and overall coding activity.

📌 Problem It Solves

Manually checking repositories to understand a developer’s coding skills is time-consuming and inefficient. GitHub doesn’t provide a quick summary of languages, activity, or project popularity in one place.

This project solves that problem by offering a clear, data-driven overview of a user’s GitHub profile — useful for developers, recruiters, and collaborators.

**GitHub Repository Analyzer**

A tool that analyzes any GitHub user’s profile and provides insights about their repositories, including most-used languages, stars, forks, and overall coding activity.

📌 Problem It Solves

Manually checking repositories to understand a developer’s coding skills is time-consuming and inefficient. GitHub doesn’t provide a quick summary of languages, activity, or project popularity in one place.

This project solves that problem by offering a clear, data-driven overview of a user’s GitHub profile — useful for developers, recruiters, and collaborators.

✨ Features

🔍 Fetch repositories by GitHub username

📊 Display most-used programming languages

⭐ Show star & fork counts for each repository

🏆 Highlight most popular repositories

📈 Provide an overall summary of coding activity


How It Works

Enter a GitHub username.

The system fetches data using the GitHub API.

The data is processed to find:

Repo names

Most-used languages

Star & fork counts

Top repositories

Insights are displayed in a clean, user-friendly interface.

📂 Use Cases

✅ Developers → Showcase coding skills with clear analytics.

✅ Recruiters → Quickly evaluate candidates’ coding habits & top projects.

✅ Students → Present GitHub as a portfolio with structured insights.
